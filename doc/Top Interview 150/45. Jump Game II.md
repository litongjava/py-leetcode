You are given a 0-indexed array of integers nums of length n. You are initially positioned at nums[0].

Each element nums[i] represents the maximum length of a forward jump from index i. In other words, if you are at nums[i], you can jump to any nums[i + j] where:

0 <= j <= nums[i] and
i + j < n
Return the minimum number of jumps to reach nums[n - 1]. The test cases are generated such that you can reach nums[n - 1].

 

Example 1:

Input: nums = [2,3,1,1,4]
Output: 2
Explanation: The minimum number of jumps to reach the last index is 2. Jump 1 step from index 0 to 1, then 3 steps to the last index.
Example 2:

Input: nums = [2,3,0,1,4]
Output: 2
 

Constraints:

1 <= nums.length <= 104
0 <= nums[i] <= 1000
It's guaranteed that you can reach nums[n - 1].

```python
class Solution(object):
    def jump(self, nums):
        """
        :type nums: List[int]
        :rtype: int
        """
```


To find the minimum number of jumps required to reach the last index in the array `nums`, you can use a greedy approach. The idea is to keep track of the current jump's range and the maximum reach within that range. Whenever the current index exceeds the maximum reach, it means you need to take another jump.

Here's the step-by-step algorithm to solve the problem:

1. Initialize three variables:
   - `jumps` - the number of jumps required.
   - `current_jump_end` - the maximum reach of the current jump.
   - `farthest` - the maximum reach within the current jump's range.

2. Iterate through the array `nums` up to the second-to-last index:
   - Update `farthest` to the maximum value between `farthest` and `i + nums[i]`.
   - If the current index `i` is equal to `current_jump_end`, it means you have reached the end of the current jump. Increment `jumps` and set `current_jump_end` to `farthest`.

3. Return the value of `jumps`, which represents the minimum number of jumps required to reach the last index.

Here's the implementation in Python:

```python
class Solution(object):
    def jump(self, nums):
        jumps = 0
        current_jump_end = 0
        farthest = 0

        for i in range(len(nums) - 1):
            farthest = max(farthest, i + nums[i])
            if i == current_jump_end:
                jumps += 1
                current_jump_end = farthest

        return jumps
```

Now, you can create an instance of the `Solution` class and call the `jump` method with the given input:

```python
solution = Solution()
nums = [2, 3, 1, 1, 4]
result = solution.jump(nums)
print(result)  # Output: 2
```

The `jump` method takes `nums` as an argument and returns the minimum number of jumps required to reach the last index.
