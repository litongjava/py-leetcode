You are given two integer arrays nums1 and nums2, sorted in non-decreasing order, and two integers m and n, representing the number of elements in nums1 and nums2 respectively.

Merge nums1 and nums2 into a single array sorted in non-decreasing order.

The final sorted array should not be returned by the function, but instead be stored inside the array nums1. To accommodate this, nums1 has a length of m + n, where the first m elements denote the elements that should be merged, and the last n elements are set to 0 and should be ignored. nums2 has a length of n.

 

Example 1:

Input: nums1 = [1,2,3,0,0,0], m = 3, nums2 = [2,5,6], n = 3
Output: [1,2,2,3,5,6]
Explanation: The arrays we are merging are [1,2,3] and [2,5,6].
The result of the merge is [1,2,2,3,5,6] with the underlined elements coming from nums1.
Example 2:

Input: nums1 = [1], m = 1, nums2 = [], n = 0
Output: [1]
Explanation: The arrays we are merging are [1] and [].
The result of the merge is [1].
Example 3:

Input: nums1 = [0], m = 0, nums2 = [1], n = 1
Output: [1]
Explanation: The arrays we are merging are [] and [1].
The result of the merge is [1].
Note that because m = 0, there are no elements in nums1. The 0 is only there to ensure the merge result can fit in nums1.
 

Constraints:

nums1.length == m + n
nums2.length == n
0 <= m, n <= 200
1 <= m + n <= 200
-109 <= nums1[i], nums2[j] <= 109
 

Follow up: Can you come up with an algorithm that runs in O(m + n) time?


To solve this problem, we can use a two-pointer approach. Since both arrays are sorted, we can compare elements from the end of both arrays and place them in the correct position in the merged array.

Here's the step-by-step algorithm to merge the arrays:

1. Initialize three pointers:
   - `p1` - pointing to the last non-zero element in `nums1`.
   - `p2` - pointing to the last element in `nums2`.
   - `p` - pointing to the last position in the merged array (`nums1`).

2. Iterate while `p1` and `p2` are greater than or equal to 0:
   - If `nums1[p1]` is greater than `nums2[p2]`, set `nums1[p]` to `nums1[p1]` and decrement `p1`.
   - Otherwise, set `nums1[p]` to `nums2[p2]` and decrement `p2`.
   - Decrement `p` by 1.

3. After the above loop, if there are any remaining elements in `nums2`, we need to copy them to `nums1`. Iterate while `p2` is greater than or equal to 0:
   - Set `nums1[p]` to `nums2[p2]` and decrement both `p2` and `p`.

4. The merged array is now stored in `nums1` with elements sorted in non-decreasing order.

Here's the implementation in Python:

```python
class Solution(object):
    def merge(self, nums1, m, nums2, n):
        p1 = m - 1
        p2 = n - 1
        p = m + n - 1

        while p1 >= 0 and p2 >= 0:
            if nums1[p1] > nums2[p2]:
                nums1[p] = nums1[p1]
                p1 -= 1
            else:
                nums1[p] = nums2[p2]
                p2 -= 1
            p -= 1

        while p2 >= 0:
            nums1[p] = nums2[p2]
            p2 -= 1
            p -= 1
```
This algorithm runs in O(m + n) time because we iterate through both `nums1` and `nums2` exactly once.

```
solution = Solution()
nums1 = [1, 2, 3, 0, 0, 0]
m = 3
nums2 = [2, 5, 6]
n = 3
solution.merge(nums1, m, nums2, n)
print(nums1)  # Output: [1, 2, 2, 3, 5, 6]
```
