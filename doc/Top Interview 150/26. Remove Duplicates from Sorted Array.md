Given an integer array nums sorted in non-decreasing order, remove the duplicates in-place such that each unique element appears only once. The relative order of the elements should be kept the same. Then return the number of unique elements in nums.

Consider the number of unique elements of nums to be k, to get accepted, you need to do the following things:

Change the array nums such that the first k elements of nums contain the unique elements in the order they were present in nums initially. The remaining elements of nums are not important as well as the size of nums.
Return k.
Custom Judge:

The judge will test your solution with the following code:

int[] nums = [...]; // Input array
int[] expectedNums = [...]; // The expected answer with correct length

int k = removeDuplicates(nums); // Calls your implementation

assert k == expectedNums.length;
for (int i = 0; i < k; i++) {
    assert nums[i] == expectedNums[i];
}
If all assertions pass, then your solution will be accepted.

 

Example 1:

Input: nums = [1,1,2]
Output: 2, nums = [1,2,_]
Explanation: Your function should return k = 2, with the first two elements of nums being 1 and 2 respectively.
It does not matter what you leave beyond the returned k (hence they are underscores).
Example 2:

Input: nums = [0,0,1,1,1,2,2,3,3,4]
Output: 5, nums = [0,1,2,3,4,_,_,_,_,_]
Explanation: Your function should return k = 5, with the first five elements of nums being 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4 respectively.
It does not matter what you leave beyond the returned k (hence they are underscores).
 

Constraints:

1 <= nums.length <= 3 * 104
-100 <= nums[i] <= 100
nums is sorted in non-decreasing order.

```python
class Solution(object):
    def removeDuplicates(self, nums):
        """
        :type nums: List[int]
        :rtype: int
        """
```

To remove duplicates from a sorted integer array `nums` in-place and return the number of unique elements, you can use a two-pointer approach. Here's the step-by-step algorithm to solve the problem:

1. If the length of `nums` is less than or equal to 1, return the length of `nums` as there are no duplicates to remove.

2. Initialize two pointers, `i` and `j`, both initially pointing to the start of the array (`0`).

3. Iterate through the array with the pointer `j`, starting from the second element:
   - If the element at `nums[j]` is equal to the element at `nums[i]`, increment `j` to skip this duplicate element.
   - If the element at `nums[j]` is not equal to the element at `nums[i]`, set `nums[i+1]` to `nums[j]`, increment both `i` and `j`, and continue the iteration.

4. Return the value of `i+1`, which represents the number of unique elements in `nums`.

Here's the implementation in Python:

```python
class Solution(object):
    def removeDuplicates(self, nums):
        if len(nums) <= 1:
            return len(nums)

        i = 0
        for j in range(1, len(nums)):
            if nums[j] != nums[i]:
                i += 1
                nums[i] = nums[j]
        return i + 1
```

Now, you can create an instance of the `Solution` class and call the `removeDuplicates` method with the given input:

```python
solution = Solution()
nums = [1, 1, 2]
k = solution.removeDuplicates(nums)
print(k)  # Output: 2
print(nums[:k])  # Output: [1, 2]
```

The `removeDuplicates` method takes `nums` as an argument and returns the number of unique elements in `nums`. The modified array `nums` will contain the unique elements in the first `k` positions.
