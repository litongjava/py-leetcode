There are n children standing in a line. Each child is assigned a rating value given in the integer array ratings.

You are giving candies to these children subjected to the following requirements:

Each child must have at least one candy.
Children with a higher rating get more candies than their neighbors.
Return the minimum number of candies you need to have to distribute the candies to the children.

 

Example 1:

Input: ratings = [1,0,2]
Output: 5
Explanation: You can allocate to the first, second and third child with 2, 1, 2 candies respectively.
Example 2:

Input: ratings = [1,2,2]
Output: 4
Explanation: You can allocate to the first, second and third child with 1, 2, 1 candies respectively.
The third child gets 1 candy because it satisfies the above two conditions.
 

Constraints:

n == ratings.length
1 <= n <= 2 * 104
0 <= ratings[i] <= 2 * 10^4

```python
class Solution(object):
    def candy(self, ratings):
        """
        :type ratings: List[int]
        :rtype: int
        """
```

To find the minimum number of candies needed to distribute to the children, you can use a greedy algorithm.

Here's the step-by-step algorithm to solve the problem:

1. Initialize an array `candies` with the same length as `ratings`, filled with ones.

2. Perform the first pass through `ratings` from left to right:
   - If the current rating is greater than the previous rating, update `candies[i]` to be one more than `candies[i-1]`.

3. Perform the second pass through `ratings` from right to left:
   - If the current rating is greater than the next rating and the corresponding `candies[i]` is less than or equal to `candies[i+1]`, update `candies[i]` to be one more than `candies[i+1]`.

4. Return the sum of the `candies` array.

Here's the implementation in Python:

```python
class Solution(object):
    def candy(self, ratings):
        n = len(ratings)
        candies = [1] * n

        for i in range(1, n):
            if ratings[i] > ratings[i-1]:
                candies[i] = candies[i-1] + 1

        for i in range(n - 2, -1, -1):
            if ratings[i] > ratings[i+1] and candies[i] <= candies[i+1]:
                candies[i] = candies[i+1] + 1

        return sum(candies)
```

Now, you can create an instance of the `Solution` class and call the `candy` method with the given input:

```python
solution = Solution()
ratings = [1, 0, 2]
result = solution.candy(ratings)
print(result)  # Output: 5
```

The `candy` method takes `ratings` as an argument and returns the minimum number of candies needed to distribute to the children. The algorithm runs in O(n) time complexity.
