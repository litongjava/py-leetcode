Given a 1-indexed array of integers numbers that is already sorted in non-decreasing order, find two numbers such that they add up to a specific target number. Let these two numbers be numbers[index1] and numbers[index2] where 1 <= index1 < index2 < numbers.length.

Return the indices of the two numbers, index1 and index2, added by one as an integer array [index1, index2] of length 2.

The tests are generated such that there is exactly one solution. You may not use the same element twice.

Your solution must use only constant extra space.

 

Example 1:

Input: numbers = [2,7,11,15], target = 9
Output: [1,2]
Explanation: The sum of 2 and 7 is 9. Therefore, index1 = 1, index2 = 2. We return [1, 2].
Example 2:

Input: numbers = [2,3,4], target = 6
Output: [1,3]
Explanation: The sum of 2 and 4 is 6. Therefore index1 = 1, index2 = 3. We return [1, 3].
Example 3:

Input: numbers = [-1,0], target = -1
Output: [1,2]
Explanation: The sum of -1 and 0 is -1. Therefore index1 = 1, index2 = 2. We return [1, 2].
 

Constraints:

2 <= numbers.length <= 3 * 104
-1000 <= numbers[i] <= 1000
numbers is sorted in non-decreasing order.
-1000 <= target <= 1000
The tests are generated such that there is exactly one solution.

```python
class Solution(object):
    def twoSum(self, numbers, target):
        """
        :type numbers: List[int]
        :type target: int
        :rtype: List[int]
        """
```

The `twoSum` function takes an array of integers `numbers` and a target number `target` as input and returns the indices of two numbers in the array that add up to the target. The indices are returned as an integer array `[index1, index2]` where `1 <= index1 < index2 < numbers.length`.

Here's an implementation of the `twoSum` function:

```python
class Solution(object):
    def twoSum(self, numbers, target):
        left = 0
        right = len(numbers) - 1
        while left < right:
            current_sum = numbers[left] + numbers[right]
            if current_sum == target:
                return [left + 1, right + 1]
            elif current_sum < target:
                left += 1
            else:
                right -= 1
        return [-1, -1]
```

In this implementation, we use two pointers `left` and `right` to traverse the array from both ends. We start with `left` at index 0 and `right` at the last index.

We calculate the sum of the numbers at the current positions `numbers[left]` and `numbers[right]`. If the sum is equal to the target, we have found the two numbers and return their indices (`[left + 1, right + 1]`). 

If the sum is less than the target, we increment `left` to consider a larger number. If the sum is greater than the target, we decrement `right` to consider a smaller number. We continue this process until we find the two numbers or the pointers meet (`left >= right`).

If we exhaust the search without finding the two numbers, we return `[-1, -1]` to indicate that there is no solution.

Now, you can create an instance of the `Solution` class and call the `twoSum` method with the given input:

```python
solution = Solution()
numbers = [2, 7, 11, 15]
target = 9
result = solution.twoSum(numbers, target)
print(result)
```

The `twoSum` method takes the `numbers` array and the `target` as arguments and returns the indices of the two numbers that add up to the target.
