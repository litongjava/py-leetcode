Given an integer array nums, rotate the array to the right by k steps, where k is non-negative.

 

Example 1:

Input: nums = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7], k = 3
Output: [5,6,7,1,2,3,4]
Explanation:
rotate 1 steps to the right: [7,1,2,3,4,5,6]
rotate 2 steps to the right: [6,7,1,2,3,4,5]
rotate 3 steps to the right: [5,6,7,1,2,3,4]
Example 2:

Input: nums = [-1,-100,3,99], k = 2
Output: [3,99,-1,-100]
Explanation: 
rotate 1 steps to the right: [99,-1,-100,3]
rotate 2 steps to the right: [3,99,-1,-100]
 

Constraints:

1 <= nums.length <= 105
-231 <= nums[i] <= 231 - 1
0 <= k <= 105

Try to come up with as many solutions as you can. There are at least three different ways to solve this problem.
Could you do it in-place with O(1) extra space?

```python
class Solution(object):
    def rotate(self, nums, k):
        """
        :type nums: List[int]
        :type k: int
        :rtype: None Do not return anything, modify nums in-place instead.
        """
```

To rotate an integer array `nums` to the right by `k` steps, you can use the following approach:

1. Calculate the effective number of rotations by taking the modulo `k` with the length of the array `nums`. This is done to handle cases where `k` is larger than the length of `nums`.

2. Reverse the entire array `nums` using the `reverse` method. This will bring the last `k` elements to the front, but they will be in reverse order.

3. Reverse the first `k` elements in the partially reversed `nums` array. This will bring the last `k` elements to their correct order.

Here's the implementation in Python:

```python
class Solution(object):
    def rotate(self, nums, k):
        k %= len(nums)
        self.reverse(nums, 0, len(nums) - 1)
        self.reverse(nums, 0, k - 1)
        self.reverse(nums, k, len(nums) - 1)

    def reverse(self, nums, start, end):
        while start < end:
            nums[start], nums[end] = nums[end], nums[start]
            start += 1
            end -= 1
```

Now, you can create an instance of the `Solution` class and call the `rotate` method with the given input:

```python
solution = Solution()
nums = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7]
k = 3
solution.rotate(nums, k)
print(nums)  # Output: [5, 6, 7, 1, 2, 3, 4]
```

The `rotate` method takes `nums` and `k` as arguments and modifies `nums` in-place to rotate the array to the right by `k` steps.
