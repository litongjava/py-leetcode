Given two strings s and t of lengths m and n respectively, return the minimum window 
substring
 of s such that every character in t (including duplicates) is included in the window. If there is no such substring, return the empty string "".

The testcases will be generated such that the answer is unique.

 

Example 1:

Input: s = "ADOBECODEBANC", t = "ABC"
Output: "BANC"
Explanation: The minimum window substring "BANC" includes 'A', 'B', and 'C' from string t.
Example 2:

Input: s = "a", t = "a"
Output: "a"
Explanation: The entire string s is the minimum window.
Example 3:

Input: s = "a", t = "aa"
Output: ""
Explanation: Both 'a's from t must be included in the window.
Since the largest window of s only has one 'a', return empty string.
 

Constraints:

m == s.length
n == t.length
1 <= m, n <= 105
s and t consist of uppercase and lowercase English letters.

```python
class Solution(object):
    def minWindow(self, s, t):
        """

        :rtype: str
        """
```

The problem you provided is the "Minimum Window Substring" problem on LeetCode. The task is to find the minimum window substring of string `s` that contains all the characters from string `t`.

To solve this problem, you can use a sliding window approach with two pointers, a `left` pointer and a `right` pointer, to maintain a sliding window containing the characters of `t`. Here's the implementation of the `minWindow` function in Python:

```python
from collections import Counter

class Solution(object):
    def minWindow(self, s, t):
        """
        :type s: str
        :type t: str
        :rtype: str
        """
        target_counts = Counter(t)  # Count of characters in t
        window_counts = Counter()  # Count of characters in the current window
        formed = 0  # Number of characters formed the desired window
        required = len(target_counts)  # Number of distinct characters in t
        
        left = 0  # Left pointer
        right = 0  # Right pointer
        min_length = float('inf')  # Minimum window length
        min_window = ""  # Minimum window substring
        
        while right < len(s):
            # Expand the window by moving the right pointer
            window_counts[s[right]] += 1
            if s[right] in target_counts and window_counts[s[right]] == target_counts[s[right]]:
                formed += 1
            
            # Contract the window by moving the left pointer
            while formed == required and left <= right:
                # Update the minimum window substring
                if right - left + 1 < min_length:
                    min_length = right - left + 1
                    min_window = s[left:right+1]
                
                # Remove the leftmost character from the window
                window_counts[s[left]] -= 1
                if s[left] in target_counts and window_counts[s[left]] < target_counts[s[left]]:
                    formed -= 1
                
                left += 1
            
            right += 1
        
        return min_window
```

The sliding window approach starts with two pointers, `left` and `right`, pointing to the beginning of the string `s`. We also have two counters, `target_counts` and `window_counts`, to keep track of the characters in `t` and the current window, respectively.

We initialize `formed` as 0 and `required` as the number of distinct characters in `t`. The `min_length` is set to infinity, and `min_window` is an empty string to store the minimum window substring.

We iterate through the string `s` using a while loop and expand the window by moving the `right` pointer. We increment the count of the current character in `window_counts`. If the current character is in `t` and the count in `window_counts` matches the count in `target_counts`, it means we have formed a required character, so we increment `formed`.

After expanding the window, we contract the window by moving the `left` pointer. We check if the current window contains all the required characters. If it does, we update `min_length` and `min_window` if the current window is smaller. Then, we remove the leftmost character from the window, decrement its count in `window_counts`, and update `formed` if necessary.

By iterating through the string with the sliding window, we find the minimum window substring that contains all the characters from `t`. Finally, we return `min_window` as the result.

The time complexity of this solution is O(m + n), where m is the length of the string `s` and n is the length of the string `t`.
