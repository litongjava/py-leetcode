Given an array of positive integers nums and a positive integer target, return the minimal length of a 
subarray
 whose sum is greater than or equal to target. If there is no such subarray, return 0 instead.

 

Example 1:

Input: target = 7, nums = [2,3,1,2,4,3]
Output: 2
Explanation: The subarray [4,3] has the minimal length under the problem constraint.
Example 2:

Input: target = 4, nums = [1,4,4]
Output: 1
Example 3:

Input: target = 11, nums = [1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1]
Output: 0
 

Constraints:

1 <= target <= 109
1 <= nums.length <= 105
1 <= nums[i] <= 104
 

Follow up: If you have figured out the O(n) solution, try coding another solution of which the time complexity is O(n log(n)).

```python
class Solution(object):
    def minSubArrayLen(self, target, nums):
        """
        :type target: int
        :type nums: List[int]
        :rtype: int
        """
```

The problem you provided is the "Minimum Size Subarray Sum" problem on LeetCode. The task is to find the minimal length of a subarray in the given array such that the sum of its elements is greater than or equal to the target value.

To solve this problem, you can use a sliding window approach. Here's the implementation of the `minSubArrayLen` function in Python:

```python
class Solution(object):
    def minSubArrayLen(self, target, nums):
        """
        :type target: int
        :type nums: List[int]
        :rtype: int
        """
        n = len(nums)
        left = 0  # left pointer
        min_length = float('inf')  # variable to store the minimal length
        current_sum = 0  # variable to store the sum of the current subarray
        
        for right in range(n):
            current_sum += nums[right]
            
            while current_sum >= target:
                min_length = min(min_length, right - left + 1)
                current_sum -= nums[left]
                left += 1
        
        if min_length == float('inf'):
            return 0
        else:
            return min_length
```

The sliding window approach starts with two pointers, `left` and `right`, pointing to the beginning of the array. We also have a variable, `current_sum`, to keep track of the sum of the current subarray.

We move the `right` pointer to the right and add the element at that position to `current_sum`. If `current_sum` becomes greater than or equal to the target, we update the `min_length` if the current subarray length is smaller than the previous minimal length.

Then, we move the `left` pointer to the right, subtracting the element at that position from `current_sum`. We continue moving the `left` pointer as long as `current_sum` is greater than or equal to the target.

By iterating through the array with the two pointers, we find the minimal length of a subarray that satisfies the sum condition. Finally, we return `min_length` if it is not equal to infinity, or 0 if no such subarray exists.

The time complexity of this solution is O(n), where n is the length of the input array.
