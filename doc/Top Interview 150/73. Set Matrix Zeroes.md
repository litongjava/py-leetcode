Given an m x n integer matrix matrix, if an element is 0, set its entire row and column to 0's.

You must do it in place.
 
Example 1:
![](images/mat73-2.jpg)

Input: matrix = [[1,1,1],[1,0,1],[1,1,1]]
Output: [[1,0,1],[0,0,0],[1,0,1]]
Example 2:
![](images/mat73-2.jpg)

Input: matrix = [[0,1,2,0],[3,4,5,2],[1,3,1,5]]
Output: [[0,0,0,0],[0,4,5,0],[0,3,1,0]]
 

Constraints:

m == matrix.length
n == matrix[0].length
1 <= m, n <= 200
-231 <= matrix[i][j] <= 231 - 1

A straightforward solution using O(mn) space is probably a bad idea.
A simple improvement uses O(m + n) space, but still not the best solution.
Could you devise a constant space solution?

```python
class Solution(object):
    def setZeroes(self, matrix):
        """
        :type matrix: List[List[int]]
        :rtype: None Do not return anything, modify matrix in-place instead.
        """
```

The problem you provided is the "Set Matrix Zeroes" problem on LeetCode. The task is to modify an m x n matrix in-place such that if an element is 0, its entire row and column are set to 0.

To solve this problem, you can use the first row and the first column of the matrix to mark the rows and columns that need to be set to 0. Here's the implementation of the `setZeroes` function in Python:

```python
class Solution(object):
    def setZeroes(self, matrix):
        """
        :type matrix: List[List[int]]
        :rtype: None Do not return anything, modify matrix in-place instead.
        """
        m, n = len(matrix), len(matrix[0])
        first_row_has_zero = any(x == 0 for x in matrix[0])
        first_col_has_zero = any(matrix[i][0] == 0 for i in range(m))
        
        # Use first row and first column as markers
        for i in range(1, m):
            for j in range(1, n):
                if matrix[i][j] == 0:
                    matrix[i][0] = 0
                    matrix[0][j] = 0
        
        # Set rows to zero
        for i in range(1, m):
            if matrix[i][0] == 0:
                for j in range(1, n):
                    matrix[i][j] = 0
        
        # Set columns to zero
        for j in range(1, n):
            if matrix[0][j] == 0:
                for i in range(1, m):
                    matrix[i][j] = 0
        
        # Set first row and first column to zero if necessary
        if first_row_has_zero:
            for j in range(n):
                matrix[0][j] = 0
        
        if first_col_has_zero:
            for i in range(m):
                matrix[i][0] = 0
```

The approach uses the first row and the first column of the matrix as markers. We iterate through the matrix and if an element is zero, we set the corresponding elements in the first row and the first column to zero.

Next, we iterate through the matrix starting from the second row and the second column. For each element, if either the corresponding element in the first row or the first column is zero, we set the element to zero.

After setting the markers and the zeros in the matrix, we check if the first row or the first column originally contains zero. If so, we set the entire first row or the first column to zero.

By using the first row and the first column as markers, we avoid using extra space and achieve the desired modification of the matrix in-place.

The time complexity of this solution is O(m * n), where m is the number of rows and n is the number of columns in the matrix.
