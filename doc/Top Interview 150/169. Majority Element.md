Given an array nums of size n, return the majority element.

The majority element is the element that appears more than ⌊n / 2⌋ times. You may assume that the majority element always exists in the array.

 

Example 1:

Input: nums = [3,2,3]
Output: 3
Example 2:

Input: nums = [2,2,1,1,1,2,2]
Output: 2
 

Constraints:

n == nums.length
1 <= n <= 5 * 104
-109 <= nums[i] <= 109
 

Follow-up: Could you solve the problem in linear time and in O(1) space?

```python
class Solution(object):
    def majorityElement(self, nums):
        """
        :type nums: List[int]
        :rtype: int
        """
```

To find the majority element in an array `nums`, you can use the Boyer-Moore Voting Algorithm. This algorithm allows us to find the majority element in linear time and with constant space complexity (O(1)).

Here's the step-by-step algorithm to solve the problem:

1. Initialize two variables, `candidate` and `count`, both initially set to None and 0, respectively. These variables will keep track of the current majority candidate and its count.

2. Iterate through the array `nums`:
   - If the `count` is 0, set the current element as the `candidate` and increment the `count` to 1.
   - If the current element is equal to the `candidate`, increment the `count` by 1.
   - If the current element is different from the `candidate`, decrement the `count` by 1.

3. At the end of the iteration, the `candidate` variable will hold the majority element.

4. Return the value of the `candidate`.

Here's the implementation in Python:

```python
class Solution(object):
    def majorityElement(self, nums):
        candidate = None
        count = 0

        for num in nums:
            if count == 0:
                candidate = num
                count = 1
            elif num == candidate:
                count += 1
            else:
                count -= 1

        return candidate
```

Now, you can create an instance of the `Solution` class and call the `majorityElement` method with the given input:

```python
solution = Solution()
nums = [3, 2, 3]
result = solution.majorityElement(nums)
print(result)  # Output: 3
```

The `majorityElement` method takes `nums` as an argument and returns the majority element.
