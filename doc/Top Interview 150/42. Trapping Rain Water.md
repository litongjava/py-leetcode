Given n non-negative integers representing an elevation map where the width of each bar is 1, compute how much water it can trap after raining.

 

Example 1:  
![Alt Text](images/rainwatertrap.png)

Input: height = [0,1,0,2,1,0,1,3,2,1,2,1]
Output: 6
Explanation: The above elevation map (black section) is represented by array [0,1,0,2,1,0,1,3,2,1,2,1]. In this case, 6 units of rain water (blue section) are being trapped.
Example 2:

Input: height = [4,2,0,3,2,5]
Output: 9
 

Constraints:

n == height.length
1 <= n <= 2 * 104
0 <= height[i] <= 105

```python
class Solution(object):
    def trap(self, height):
        """
        :type height: List[int]
        :rtype: int
        """
```

To compute how much water can be trapped after raining in the elevation map, you can use a two-pointer approach.

Here's the step-by-step algorithm to solve the problem:

1. Initialize two pointers, `left` and `right`, to the start and end of the elevation map, respectively.
2. Initialize variables `left_max` and `right_max` to 0, which represent the maximum elevation encountered from the left and right sides, respectively.
3. Initialize a variable `water` to 0, which represents the total amount of water trapped.
4. While `left` is less than or equal to `right`:
   - If `height[left]` is less than or equal to `height[right]`:
     - If `height[left]` is greater than `left_max`, update `left_max` to `height[left]`.
     - Otherwise, calculate the water trapped at `left` as `left_max - height[left]` and add it to `water`.
     - Increment `left` by 1.
   - Otherwise, if `height[right]` is greater than `right_max`:
     - Update `right_max` to `height[right]`.
     - Otherwise, calculate the water trapped at `right` as `right_max - height[right]` and add it to `water`.
     - Decrement `right` by 1.
5. Return the value of `water`.

Here's the implementation in Python:

```python
class Solution(object):
    def trap(self, height):
        n = len(height)
        left = 0
        right = n - 1
        left_max = 0
        right_max = 0
        water = 0

        while left <= right:
            if height[left] <= height[right]:
                if height[left] > left_max:
                    left_max = height[left]
                else:
                    water += left_max - height[left]
                left += 1
            else:
                if height[right] > right_max:
                    right_max = height[right]
                else:
                    water += right_max - height[right]
                right -= 1

        return water
```

Now, you can create an instance of the `Solution` class and call the `trap` method with the given input:

```python
solution = Solution()
height = [0, 1, 0, 2, 1, 0, 1, 3, 2, 1, 2, 1]
result = solution.trap(height)
print(result)  # Output: 6
```

The `trap` method takes `height` as an argument and returns the total amount of water that can be trapped. The algorithm runs in O(n) time complexity.
