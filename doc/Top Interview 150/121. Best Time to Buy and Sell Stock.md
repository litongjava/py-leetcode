You are given an array prices where prices[i] is the price of a given stock on the ith day.

You want to maximize your profit by choosing a single day to buy one stock and choosing a different day in the future to sell that stock.

Return the maximum profit you can achieve from this transaction. If you cannot achieve any profit, return 0.

 

Example 1:

Input: prices = [7,1,5,3,6,4]
Output: 5
Explanation: Buy on day 2 (price = 1) and sell on day 5 (price = 6), profit = 6-1 = 5.
Note that buying on day 2 and selling on day 1 is not allowed because you must buy before you sell.
Example 2:

Input: prices = [7,6,4,3,1]
Output: 0
Explanation: In this case, no transactions are done and the max profit = 0.
 

Constraints:

1 <= prices.length <= 10^5
0 <= prices[i] <= 10^4

```python
class Solution(object):
    def maxProfit(self, prices):
        """
        :type prices: List[int]
        :rtype: int
        """
```

To maximize the profit by buying and selling a stock, you can use a simple approach that involves keeping track of the minimum price encountered so far and calculating the maximum profit based on that.

Here's the step-by-step algorithm to solve the problem:

1. Initialize two variables, `min_price` and `max_profit`. Set `min_price` to infinity and `max_profit` to 0.

2. Iterate through the prices array:
   - Update `min_price` to the minimum value between the current price and `min_price`.
   - Update `max_profit` to the maximum value between the current price minus `min_price` and `max_profit`.

3. Return the value of `max_profit`, which represents the maximum profit achievable by buying and selling the stock.

Here's the implementation in Python:

```python
class Solution(object):
    def maxProfit(self, prices):
        min_price = float('inf')
        max_profit = 0

        for price in prices:
            min_price = min(min_price, price)
            max_profit = max(max_profit, price - min_price)

        return max_profit
```

Now, you can create an instance of the `Solution` class and call the `maxProfit` method with the given input:

```python
solution = Solution()
prices = [7, 1, 5, 3, 6, 4]
result = solution.maxProfit(prices)
print(result)  # Output: 5
```

The `maxProfit` method takes `prices` as an argument and returns the maximum profit that can be achieved by buying and selling the stock.
