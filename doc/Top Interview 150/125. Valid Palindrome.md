A phrase is a palindrome if, after converting all uppercase letters into lowercase letters and removing all non-alphanumeric characters, it reads the same forward and backward. Alphanumeric characters include letters and numbers.

Given a string s, return true if it is a palindrome, or false otherwise.

 

Example 1:

Input: s = "A man, a plan, a canal: Panama"
Output: true
Explanation: "amanaplanacanalpanama" is a palindrome.
Example 2:

Input: s = "race a car"
Output: false
Explanation: "raceacar" is not a palindrome.
Example 3:

Input: s = " "
Output: true
Explanation: s is an empty string "" after removing non-alphanumeric characters.
Since an empty string reads the same forward and backward, it is a palindrome.
 

Constraints:

1 <= s.length <= 2 * 105
s consists only of printable ASCII characters.

```python
class Solution(object):
    def isPalindrome(self, s):
        """
        :type s: str
        :rtype: bool
        """
```

The `isPalindrome` function takes a string `s` as input and returns `True` if it is a palindrome and `False` otherwise. To determine if a string is a palindrome, we need to check if it reads the same forward and backward after converting all uppercase letters to lowercase and removing all non-alphanumeric characters.

Here's an implementation of the `isPalindrome` function:

```python
class Solution(object):
    def isPalindrome(self, s):
        s = ''.join(c.lower() for c in s if c.isalnum())
        return s == s[::-1]
```

In this implementation, we use a list comprehension to iterate over each character `c` in `s` and keep only the alphanumeric characters by using the `isalnum` method. We convert all characters to lowercase using the `lower` method. Finally, we compare the modified string `s` with its reverse (`s[::-1]`) to check if it is a palindrome.

Now, you can create an instance of the `Solution` class and call the `isPalindrome` method with the given input:

```python
solution = Solution()
s = "A man, a plan, a canal: Panama"
result = solution.isPalindrome(s)
print(result)
```

The `isPalindrome` method takes the string `s` as an argument and returns `True` if it is a palindrome and `False` otherwise.
