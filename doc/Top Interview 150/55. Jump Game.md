You are given an integer array nums. You are initially positioned at the array's first index, and each element in the array represents your maximum jump length at that position.

Return true if you can reach the last index, or false otherwise.

 

Example 1:

Input: nums = [2,3,1,1,4]
Output: true
Explanation: Jump 1 step from index 0 to 1, then 3 steps to the last index.
Example 2:

Input: nums = [3,2,1,0,4]
Output: false
Explanation: You will always arrive at index 3 no matter what. Its maximum jump length is 0, which makes it impossible to reach the last index.
 

Constraints:

1 <= nums.length <= 104
0 <= nums[i] <= 105

```python
class Solution(object):
    def canJump(self, nums):
        """
        :type nums: List[int]
        :rtype: bool
        """
```

To determine whether you can reach the last index of the array `nums` based on the maximum jump length at each position, you can use a greedy approach. The idea is to keep track of the maximum reachable index as you iterate through the array.

Here's the step-by-step algorithm to solve the problem:

1. Initialize a variable `max_reach` to 0, which represents the maximum reachable index.

2. Iterate through the array `nums`:
   - If the current index `i` is greater than `max_reach`, it means that you cannot reach index `i`, so return `False`.
   - Otherwise, update `max_reach` to the maximum value between `max_reach` and `i + nums[i]`.

3. If the loop completes without encountering any index that is unreachable, return `True`.

Here's the implementation in Python:

```python
class Solution(object):
    def canJump(self, nums):
        max_reach = 0

        for i in range(len(nums)):
            if i > max_reach:
                return False
            max_reach = max(max_reach, i + nums[i])

        return True
```

Now, you can create an instance of the `Solution` class and call the `canJump` method with the given input:

```python
solution = Solution()
nums = [2, 3, 1, 1, 4]
result = solution.canJump(nums)
print(result)  # Output: True
```

The `canJump` method takes `nums` as an argument and returns `True` if you can reach the last index, or `False` otherwise.
