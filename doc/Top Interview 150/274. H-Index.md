Given an array of integers citations where citations[i] is the number of citations a researcher received for their ith paper, return the researcher's h-index.

According to the definition of h-index on Wikipedia: The h-index is defined as the maximum value of h such that the given researcher has published at least h papers that have each been cited at least h times.

 

Example 1:

Input: citations = [3,0,6,1,5]
Output: 3
Explanation: [3,0,6,1,5] means the researcher has 5 papers in total and each of them had received 3, 0, 6, 1, 5 citations respectively.
Since the researcher has 3 papers with at least 3 citations each and the remaining two with no more than 3 citations each, their h-index is 3.
Example 2:

Input: citations = [1,3,1]
Output: 1
 

Constraints:

n == citations.length
1 <= n <= 5000
0 <= citations[i] <= 1000

```python
class Solution(object):
    def hIndex(self, citations):
        """
        :type citations: List[int]
        :rtype: int
        """
```

To find the researcher's h-index based on the array `citations`, you can use a sorting approach. The h-index is defined as the maximum value of `h` such that the researcher has published at least `h` papers that have each been cited at least `h` times.

Here's the step-by-step algorithm to solve the problem:

1. Sort the `citations` array in non-decreasing order.

2. Initialize two pointers, `left` and `right`, both initially pointing to the start and end of the array, respectively.

3. Iterate while `left` is less than or equal to `right`:
   - Calculate the midpoint between `left` and `right` as `mid`.
   - If the value at `citations[mid]` is greater than or equal to `n - mid`, it means there are at least `n - mid` papers with citations greater than or equal to `n - mid`. Move `right` to `mid - 1` to search for a smaller `h`.
   - Otherwise, move `left` to `mid + 1` to search for a larger `h`.

4. Return `n - left`, which represents the h-index.

Here's the implementation in Python:

```python
class Solution(object):
    def hIndex(self, citations):
        citations.sort()
        n = len(citations)
        left, right = 0, n - 1

        while left <= right:
            mid = (left + right) // 2
            if citations[mid] >= n - mid:
                right = mid - 1
            else:
                left = mid + 1

        return n - left
```

Now, you can create an instance of the `Solution` class and call the `hIndex` method with the given input:

```python
solution = Solution()
citations = [3, 0, 6, 1, 5]
result = solution.hIndex(citations)
print(result)  # Output: 3
```

The `hIndex` method takes `citations` as an argument and returns the researcher's h-index.
