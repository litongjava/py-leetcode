Given an integer array nums sorted in non-decreasing order, remove some duplicates in-place such that each unique element appears at most twice. The relative order of the elements should be kept the same.

Since it is impossible to change the length of the array in some languages, you must instead have the result be placed in the first part of the array nums. More formally, if there are k elements after removing the duplicates, then the first k elements of nums should hold the final result. It does not matter what you leave beyond the first k elements.

Return k after placing the final result in the first k slots of nums.

Do not allocate extra space for another array. You must do this by modifying the input array in-place with O(1) extra memory.

Custom Judge:

The judge will test your solution with the following code:

int[] nums = [...]; // Input array
int[] expectedNums = [...]; // The expected answer with correct length

int k = removeDuplicates(nums); // Calls your implementation

assert k == expectedNums.length;
for (int i = 0; i < k; i++) {
    assert nums[i] == expectedNums[i];
}
If all assertions pass, then your solution will be accepted.

 

Example 1:

Input: nums = [1,1,1,2,2,3]
Output: 5, nums = [1,1,2,2,3,_]
Explanation: Your function should return k = 5, with the first five elements of nums being 1, 1, 2, 2 and 3 respectively.
It does not matter what you leave beyond the returned k (hence they are underscores).
Example 2:

Input: nums = [0,0,1,1,1,1,2,3,3]
Output: 7, nums = [0,0,1,1,2,3,3,_,_]
Explanation: Your function should return k = 7, with the first seven elements of nums being 0, 0, 1, 1, 2, 3 and 3 respectively.
It does not matter what you leave beyond the returned k (hence they are underscores).
 

Constraints:

1 <= nums.length <= 3 * 104
-104 <= nums[i] <= 104
nums is sorted in non-decreasing order.

```python
class Solution(object):
    def removeDuplicates(self, nums):
        """
        :type nums: List[int]
        :rtype: int
        """
```

To remove duplicates from a sorted integer array `nums` in-place, allowing each unique element to appear at most twice, you can use a two-pointer approach. Here's the step-by-step algorithm to solve the problem:

1. If the length of `nums` is less than or equal to 2, return the length of `nums` as there are no duplicates to remove or there can be at most two elements.

2. Initialize two pointers, `i` and `j`, both initially pointing to the start of the array (`0`).

3. Initialize a variable `count` to keep track of the number of occurrences of the current element.

4. Iterate through the array with the pointer `j`, starting from the second element:
   - If the element at `nums[j]` is equal to the element at `nums[i]` and `count` is less than 2, increment `count`, set `nums[i+1]` to `nums[j]`, increment both `i` and `j`, and continue the iteration.
   - If the element at `nums[j]` is equal to the element at `nums[i]` but `count` is already 2, increment `j` to skip this duplicate element.
   - If the element at `nums[j]` is not equal to the element at `nums[i]`, set `nums[i+1]` to `nums[j]`, reset `count` to 1, and increment both `i` and `j`.

5. Return the value of `i+1`, which represents the number of unique elements in `nums`.

Here's the implementation in Python:

```python
class Solution(object):
    def removeDuplicates(self, nums):
        if len(nums) <= 2:
            return len(nums)

        i = 0
        count = 1

        for j in range(1, len(nums)):
            if nums[j] == nums[i]:
                if count < 2:
                    i += 1
                    nums[i] = nums[j]
                    count += 1
            else:
                i += 1
                nums[i] = nums[j]
                count = 1

        return i + 1
```

Now, you can create an instance of the `Solution` class and call the `removeDuplicates` method with the given input:

```python
solution = Solution()
nums = [1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 3]
k = solution.removeDuplicates(nums)
print(k)  # Output: 5
print(nums[:k])  # Output: [1, 1, 2, 2, 3]
```

The `removeDuplicates` method takes `nums` as an argument and returns the number of unique elements in `nums`. The modified array `nums` will contain the unique elements, with each element appearing at most twice, in the first `k` positions.
