Roman numerals are represented by seven different symbols: I, V, X, L, C, D and M.

Symbol       Value
I             1
V             5
X             10
L             50
C             100
D             500
M             1000
For example, 2 is written as II in Roman numeral, just two ones added together. 12 is written as XII, which is simply X + II. The number 27 is written as XXVII, which is XX + V + II.

Roman numerals are usually written largest to smallest from left to right. However, the numeral for four is not IIII. Instead, the number four is written as IV. Because the one is before the five we subtract it making four. The same principle applies to the number nine, which is written as IX. There are six instances where subtraction is used:

I can be placed before V (5) and X (10) to make 4 and 9. 
X can be placed before L (50) and C (100) to make 40 and 90. 
C can be placed before D (500) and M (1000) to make 400 and 900.
Given a roman numeral, convert it to an integer.

 

Example 1:

Input: s = "III"
Output: 3
Explanation: III = 3.
Example 2:

Input: s = "LVIII"
Output: 58
Explanation: L = 50, V= 5, III = 3.
Example 3:

Input: s = "MCMXCIV"
Output: 1994
Explanation: M = 1000, CM = 900, XC = 90 and IV = 4.
 

Constraints:

1 <= s.length <= 15
s contains only the characters ('I', 'V', 'X', 'L', 'C', 'D', 'M').
It is guaranteed that s is a valid roman numeral in the range [1, 3999].

```python
class Solution(object):
    def romanToInt(self, s):
        """
        :type s: str
        :rtype: int
        """
```

To convert a Roman numeral to an integer, you can iterate over the characters of the input string from left to right. 

Here's the step-by-step algorithm to solve the problem:

1. Create a dictionary that maps each Roman numeral symbol to its corresponding value:

   ```python
   roman_values = {
       'I': 1,
       'V': 5,
       'X': 10,
       'L': 50,
       'C': 100,
       'D': 500,
       'M': 1000
   }
   ```

2. Initialize a variable `result` to 0, which will hold the final integer value.
3. Iterate over the characters `c` in the input string `s`:
   - If the current character `c` is smaller than the next character (according to their values), subtract the value of `c` from the result.
   - Otherwise, add the value of `c` to the result.
4. Return the final value of `result`.

Here's the implementation in Python:

```python
class Solution(object):
    def romanToInt(self, s):
        roman_values = {
            'I': 1,
            'V': 5,
            'X': 10,
            'L': 50,
            'C': 100,
            'D': 500,
            'M': 1000
        }
        
        result = 0
        n = len(s)
        
        for i in range(n):
            if i < n - 1 and roman_values[s[i]] < roman_values[s[i+1]]:
                result -= roman_values[s[i]]
            else:
                result += roman_values[s[i]]
        
        return result
```

Now, you can create an instance of the `Solution` class and call the `romanToInt` method with the given input:

```python
solution = Solution()
s = "MCMXCIV"
result = solution.romanToInt(s)
print(result)  # Output: 1994
```

The `romanToInt` method takes `s` as an argument and returns the corresponding integer value. The algorithm runs in O(n) time complexity, where n is the length of the input string `s`.
