Given an m x n matrix, return all elements of the matrix in spiral order.

 

Example 1:
![](images/spiral1.jpg)

Input: matrix = [[1,2,3],[4,5,6],[7,8,9]]
Output: [1,2,3,6,9,8,7,4,5]
Example 2:
![](images/spiral.jpg)


Input: matrix = [[1,2,3,4],[5,6,7,8],[9,10,11,12]]
Output: [1,2,3,4,8,12,11,10,9,5,6,7]
 

Constraints:

m == matrix.length
n == matrix[i].length
1 <= m, n <= 10
-100 <= matrix[i][j] <= 100
```python
class Solution(object):
    def spiralOrder(self, matrix):
        """
        :type matrix: List[List[int]]
        :rtype: List[int]
        """
        
```
The problem you provided is the "Spiral Matrix" problem on LeetCode. The task is to return all elements of an m x n matrix in spiral order.

To solve this problem, you can use a layer-by-layer approach, where you iterate through the matrix layer by layer, moving from the outermost layer to the innermost layer. Here's the implementation of the `spiralOrder` function in Python:

```python
class Solution(object):
    def spiralOrder(self, matrix):
        """
        :type matrix: List[List[int]]
        :rtype: List[int]
        """
        if not matrix:
            return []
        
        m, n = len(matrix), len(matrix[0])
        result = []
        left, right = 0, n - 1
        top, bottom = 0, m - 1
        
        while left <= right and top <= bottom:
            # Traverse top row
            for col in range(left, right + 1):
                result.append(matrix[top][col])
            top += 1
            
            # Traverse right column
            for row in range(top, bottom + 1):
                result.append(matrix[row][right])
            right -= 1
            
            if top <= bottom:
                # Traverse bottom row
                for col in range(right, left - 1, -1):
                    result.append(matrix[bottom][col])
                bottom -= 1
            
            if left <= right:
                # Traverse left column
                for row in range(bottom, top - 1, -1):
                    result.append(matrix[row][left])
                left += 1
        
        return result
```

The layer-by-layer approach starts with initializing the boundaries of the matrix: `left` as the leftmost column, `right` as the rightmost column, `top` as the top row, and `bottom` as the bottom row.

We then enter a while loop that continues until the `left` boundary is greater than the `right` boundary or the `top` boundary is greater than the `bottom` boundary.

Inside the loop, we traverse the top row from left to right and add the elements to the `result` list. We increment the `top` boundary to move to the next row.

Next, we traverse the right column from top to bottom and add the elements to the `result` list. We decrement the `right` boundary to move to the next column.

If the `top` boundary is still less than or equal to the `bottom` boundary, we traverse the bottom row from right to left and add the elements to the `result` list. We decrement the `bottom` boundary to move to the next row.

If the `left` boundary is still less than or equal to the `right` boundary, we traverse the left column from bottom to top and add the elements to the `result` list. We increment the `left` boundary to move to the next column.

By iteratively traversing the matrix layer by layer, we collect all the elements in spiral order. Finally, we return the `result` list.

The time complexity of this solution is O(m * n), where m is the number of rows and n is the number of columns in the matrix.
