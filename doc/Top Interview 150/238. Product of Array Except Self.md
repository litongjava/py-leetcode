Given an integer array nums, return an array answer such that answer[i] is equal to the product of all the elements of nums except nums[i].

The product of any prefix or suffix of nums is guaranteed to fit in a 32-bit integer.

You must write an algorithm that runs in O(n) time and without using the division operation.

 

Example 1:

Input: nums = [1,2,3,4]
Output: [24,12,8,6]
Example 2:

Input: nums = [-1,1,0,-3,3]
Output: [0,0,9,0,0]
 

Constraints:

2 <= nums.length <= 105
-30 <= nums[i] <= 30
The product of any prefix or suffix of nums is guaranteed to fit in a 32-bit integer.
 

Follow up: Can you solve the problem in O(1) extra space complexity? (The output array does not count as extra space for space complexity analysis.)

```python
class Solution(object):
    def productExceptSelf(self, nums):
        """
        :type nums: List[int]
        :rtype: List[int]
        """
```

To find an array `answer` where `answer[i]` is equal to the product of all the elements of `nums` except `nums[i]`, you can use two passes through the array.

Here's the step-by-step algorithm to solve the problem:

1. Initialize an array `answer` with the same length as `nums`, filled with ones.

2. Perform the first pass through `nums`:
   - Initialize a variable `left_prod` to 1, which represents the product of all the elements to the left of the current element.
   - Iterate through `nums` from left to right:
     - Update `answer[i]` to be equal to `left_prod`.
     - Update `left_prod` by multiplying it with `nums[i]`.

3. Perform the second pass through `nums`:
   - Initialize a variable `right_prod` to 1, which represents the product of all the elements to the right of the current element.
   - Iterate through `nums` from right to left:
     - Update `answer[i]` by multiplying it with `right_prod`.
     - Update `right_prod` by multiplying it with `nums[i]`.

4. Return the resulting `answer` array.

Here's the implementation in Python:

```python
class Solution(object):
    def productExceptSelf(self, nums):
        n = len(nums)
        answer = [1] * n

        left_prod = 1
        for i in range(n):
            answer[i] *= left_prod
            left_prod *= nums[i]

        right_prod = 1
        for i in range(n - 1, -1, -1):
            answer[i] *= right_prod
            right_prod *= nums[i]

        return answer
```

Now, you can create an instance of the `Solution` class and call the `productExceptSelf` method with the given input:

```python
solution = Solution()
nums = [1, 2, 3, 4]
result = solution.productExceptSelf(nums)
print(result)  # Output: [24, 12, 8, 6]
```

The `productExceptSelf` method takes `nums` as an argument and returns the array `answer` where `answer[i]` is equal to the product of all the elements of `nums` except `nums[i]`. The algorithm has a time complexity of O(n) and doesn't use the division operation.
