Given an integer array nums, return all the triplets [nums[i], nums[j], nums[k]] such that i != j, i != k, and j != k, and nums[i] + nums[j] + nums[k] == 0.

Notice that the solution set must not contain duplicate triplets.

 

Example 1:

Input: nums = [-1,0,1,2,-1,-4]
Output: [[-1,-1,2],[-1,0,1]]
Explanation: 
nums[0] + nums[1] + nums[2] = (-1) + 0 + 1 = 0.
nums[1] + nums[2] + nums[4] = 0 + 1 + (-1) = 0.
nums[0] + nums[3] + nums[4] = (-1) + 2 + (-1) = 0.
The distinct triplets are [-1,0,1] and [-1,-1,2].
Notice that the order of the output and the order of the triplets does not matter.
Example 2:

Input: nums = [0,1,1]
Output: []
Explanation: The only possible triplet does not sum up to 0.
Example 3:

Input: nums = [0,0,0]
Output: [[0,0,0]]
Explanation: The only possible triplet sums up to 0.
 

Constraints:

3 <= nums.length <= 3000
-105 <= nums[i] <= 105

```python
class Solution(object):
    def threeSum(self, nums):
        """
        :type nums: List[int]
        :rtype: List[List[int]]
        """
```
The problem you provided is the "3Sum" problem on LeetCode. The task is to find all unique triplets in the given array such that their sum is zero.

To solve this problem, you can use a two-pointer approach combined with sorting the array. Here's the implementation of the `threeSum` function in Python:

```python
class Solution(object):
    def threeSum(self, nums):
        """
        :type nums: List[int]
        :rtype: List[List[int]]
        """
        result = []
        nums.sort()  # Sort the array in ascending order
        
        for i in range(len(nums) - 2):
            # Skip duplicates for the first number
            if i > 0 and nums[i] == nums[i-1]:
                continue
            
            left = i + 1  # left pointer
            right = len(nums) - 1  # right pointer
            
            while left < right:
                current_sum = nums[i] + nums[left] + nums[right]
                
                if current_sum < 0:
                    left += 1  # Move left pointer to the right
                elif current_sum > 0:
                    right -= 1  # Move right pointer to the left
                else:
                    # Found a triplet with sum = 0
                    result.append([nums[i], nums[left], nums[right]])
                    
                    # Skip duplicates for the second number
                    while left < right and nums[left] == nums[left + 1]:
                        left += 1
                    # Skip duplicates for the third number
                    while left < right and nums[right] == nums[right - 1]:
                        right -= 1
                    
                    # Move both pointers towards the center
                    left += 1
                    right -= 1
        
        return result
```

The two-pointer approach starts by sorting the array `nums` in ascending order. Then, we iterate through the array using a for loop, considering each element as the potential first number of the triplet.

Inside the loop, we use two pointers, `left` and `right`, to find the other two numbers that can form a triplet with the current first number. We calculate the `current_sum` as the sum of the three numbers.

If the `current_sum` is less than zero, it means we need a larger sum, so we increment the `left` pointer. If the `current_sum` is greater than zero, it means we need a smaller sum, so we decrement the `right` pointer. If the `current_sum` is zero, we have found a triplet, so we add it to the `result`.

To avoid duplicate triplets, we skip duplicate values for the second and third numbers by incrementing `left` and decrementing `right` as necessary.

The time complexity of this solution is O(n^2), where n is the length of the input array. Sorting the array takes O(n log n) time, and the two-pointer approach takes O(n^2) time in the worst case.
