Given two strings needle and haystack, return the index of the first occurrence of needle in haystack, or -1 if needle is not part of haystack.

 

Example 1:

Input: haystack = "sadbutsad", needle = "sad"
Output: 0
Explanation: "sad" occurs at index 0 and 6.
The first occurrence is at index 0, so we return 0.
Example 2:

Input: haystack = "leetcode", needle = "leeto"
Output: -1
Explanation: "leeto" did not occur in "leetcode", so we return -1.
 

Constraints:

1 <= haystack.length, needle.length <= 104
haystack and needle consist of only lowercase English characters.

```python
class Solution(object):
    def strStr(self, haystack, needle):
        """
        :type haystack: str
        :type needle: str
        :rtype: int
        """
```

To find the index of the first occurrence of the string `needle` in the string `haystack`, you can use the `str.find()` method in Python. The `str.find()` method returns the lowest index in the string where the substring `needle` is found, or -1 if it is not found.

Here's the implementation of the `strStr()` method using `str.find()`:

```python
class Solution(object):
    def strStr(self, haystack, needle):
        return haystack.find(needle)
```

Now, you can create an instance of the `Solution` class and call the `strStr` method with the given input:

```python
solution = Solution()
haystack = "sadbutsad"
needle = "sad"
result = solution.strStr(haystack, needle)
print(result)  # Output: 0
```

The `strStr` method takes `haystack` and `needle` as arguments and returns the index of the first occurrence of `needle` in `haystack`, or -1 if it is not found.
