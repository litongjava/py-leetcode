There are n gas stations along a circular route, where the amount of gas at the ith station is gas[i].

You have a car with an unlimited gas tank and it costs cost[i] of gas to travel from the ith station to its next (i + 1)th station. You begin the journey with an empty tank at one of the gas stations.

Given two integer arrays gas and cost, return the starting gas station's index if you can travel around the circuit once in the clockwise direction, otherwise return -1. If there exists a solution, it is guaranteed to be unique

 

Example 1:

Input: gas = [1,2,3,4,5], cost = [3,4,5,1,2]
Output: 3
Explanation:
Start at station 3 (index 3) and fill up with 4 unit of gas. Your tank = 0 + 4 = 4
Travel to station 4. Your tank = 4 - 1 + 5 = 8
Travel to station 0. Your tank = 8 - 2 + 1 = 7
Travel to station 1. Your tank = 7 - 3 + 2 = 6
Travel to station 2. Your tank = 6 - 4 + 3 = 5
Travel to station 3. The cost is 5. Your gas is just enough to travel back to station 3.
Therefore, return 3 as the starting index.
Example 2:

Input: gas = [2,3,4], cost = [3,4,3]
Output: -1
Explanation:
You can't start at station 0 or 1, as there is not enough gas to travel to the next station.
Let's start at station 2 and fill up with 4 unit of gas. Your tank = 0 + 4 = 4
Travel to station 0. Your tank = 4 - 3 + 2 = 3
Travel to station 1. Your tank = 3 - 3 + 3 = 3
You cannot travel back to station 2, as it requires 4 unit of gas but you only have 3.
Therefore, you can't travel around the circuit once no matter where you start.
 

Constraints:

n == gas.length == cost.length
1 <= n <= 105
0 <= gas[i], cost[i] <= 10^4

```python
class Solution(object):
    def canCompleteCircuit(self, gas, cost):
        """
        :type gas: List[int]
        :type cost: List[int]
        :rtype: int
        """
```

To find the starting gas station's index if you can travel around the circuit once in the clockwise direction, you can use a greedy algorithm.

Here's the step-by-step algorithm to solve the problem:

1. Initialize `total_tank` and `curr_tank` to 0, which represent the total gas and the current gas in the tank, respectively.

2. Initialize `start_idx` to 0, which represents the starting gas station's index.

3. Iterate through the gas stations from left to right:
   - Update `total_tank` by adding `gas[i] - cost[i]`.
   - Update `curr_tank` by adding `gas[i] - cost[i]`.
   - If `curr_tank` is negative, it means that starting from the current gas station is not possible, so set `start_idx` to the next gas station and reset `curr_tank` to 0.

4. If `total_tank` is negative, it means that the total gas is not enough to complete the circuit, so return -1.

5. Otherwise, return `start_idx`.

Here's the implementation in Python:

```python
class Solution(object):
    def canCompleteCircuit(self, gas, cost):
        n = len(gas)
        total_tank = 0
        curr_tank = 0
        start_idx = 0

        for i in range(n):
            total_tank += gas[i] - cost[i]
            curr_tank += gas[i] - cost[i]
            if curr_tank < 0:
                start_idx = i + 1
                curr_tank = 0

        if total_tank < 0:
            return -1
        else:
            return start_idx
```

Now, you can create an instance of the `Solution` class and call the `canCompleteCircuit` method with the given input:

```python
solution = Solution()
gas = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
cost = [3, 4, 5, 1, 2]
result = solution.canCompleteCircuit(gas, cost)
print(result)  # Output: 3
```

The `canCompleteCircuit` method takes `gas` and `cost` as arguments and returns the starting gas station's index if it is possible to travel around the circuit once in the clockwise direction. If there is no solution, it returns -1. The algorithm runs in O(n) time complexity.
