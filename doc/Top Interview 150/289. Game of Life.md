According to Wikipedia's article: "The Game of Life, also known simply as Life, is a cellular automaton devised by the British mathematician John Horton Conway in 1970."

The board is made up of an m x n grid of cells, where each cell has an initial state: live (represented by a 1) or dead (represented by a 0). Each cell interacts with its eight neighbors (horizontal, vertical, diagonal) using the following four rules (taken from the above Wikipedia article):

Any live cell with fewer than two live neighbors dies as if caused by under-population.
Any live cell with two or three live neighbors lives on to the next generation.
Any live cell with more than three live neighbors dies, as if by over-population.
Any dead cell with exactly three live neighbors becomes a live cell, as if by reproduction.
The next state is created by applying the above rules simultaneously to every cell in the current state, where births and deaths occur simultaneously. Given the current state of the m x n grid board, return the next state.

 

Example 1:  
![](images/grid1.jpg)

Input: board = [[0,1,0],[0,0,1],[1,1,1],[0,0,0]]
Output: [[0,0,0],[1,0,1],[0,1,1],[0,1,0]]
Example 2:  
![](images/grid2.jpg)

Input: board = [[1,1],[1,0]]
Output: [[1,1],[1,1]]
 

Constraints:

m == board.length
n == board[i].length
1 <= m, n <= 25
board[i][j] is 0 or 1.

Could you solve it in-place? Remember that the board needs to be updated simultaneously: You cannot update some cells first and then use their updated values to update other cells.
In this question, we represent the board using a 2D array. In principle, the board is infinite, which would cause problems when the active area encroaches upon the border of the array (i.e., live cells reach the border). How would you address these problems?

The problem you provided is the "Game of Life" problem on LeetCode. The task is to update the given m x n grid of cells according to the rules of the Game of Life.

To solve this problem, you can perform an in-place update of the grid by using additional states to represent the current and next states of each cell. Here's the implementation of the `gameOfLife` function in Python:

```python
class Solution(object):
    def gameOfLife(self, board):
        """
        :type board: List[List[int]]
        :rtype: None Do not return anything, modify board in-place instead.
        """
        m, n = len(board), len(board[0])
        
        # Define the eight possible neighbors
        neighbors = [(1, 0), (-1, 0), (0, 1), (0, -1), (1, 1), (-1, -1), (1, -1), (-1, 1)]
        
        for i in range(m):
            for j in range(n):
                live_neighbors = 0
                
                # Count the live neighbors
                for neighbor in neighbors:
                    row = i + neighbor[0]
                    col = j + neighbor[1]
                    
                    if 0 <= row < m and 0 <= col < n and abs(board[row][col]) == 1:
                        live_neighbors += 1
                
                # Apply the rules of the Game of Life
                if board[i][j] == 1 and (live_neighbors < 2 or live_neighbors > 3):
                    # Cell dies due to under-population or over-population
                    board[i][j] = -1
                elif board[i][j] == 0 and live_neighbors == 3:
                    # Cell becomes alive due to reproduction
                    board[i][j] = 2
        
        # Update the board to the next state
        for i in range(m):
            for j in range(n):
                if board[i][j] == 2:
                    board[i][j] = 1
                elif board[i][j] == -1:
                    board[i][j] = 0
```

In this solution, we iterate through each cell in the grid and count the number of live neighbors for each cell. We consider each of the eight possible neighbors, including diagonal neighbors.

After counting the live neighbors, we apply the rules of the Game of Life to determine the next state of each cell. If a live cell has fewer than two or more than three live neighbors, it dies. If a dead cell has exactly three live neighbors, it becomes alive.

To update the grid in-place, we use two additional states: -1 represents a live cell that becomes dead, and 2 represents a dead cell that becomes alive. This allows us to distinguish between the current and next states of each cell.

Finally, we update the grid to the next state by replacing the cell values accordingly.

The time complexity of this solution is O(m * n), where m is the number of rows and n is the number of columns in the grid.
