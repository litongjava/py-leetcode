Write a function to find the longest common prefix string amongst an array of strings.

If there is no common prefix, return an empty string "".

 

Example 1:

Input: strs = ["flower","flow","flight"]
Output: "fl"
Example 2:

Input: strs = ["dog","racecar","car"]
Output: ""
Explanation: There is no common prefix among the input strings.
 

Constraints:

1 <= strs.length <= 200
0 <= strs[i].length <= 200
strs[i] consists of only lowercase English letters.

```python
class Solution(object):
    def longestCommonPrefix(self, strs):
        """
        :type strs: List[str]
        :rtype: str
        """
```

To find the longest common prefix among an array of strings `strs`, you can follow the following algorithm:

1. If the `strs` array is empty, return an empty string "".
2. Initialize the `prefix` variable with the first string in the array.
3. Iterate through the remaining strings in the array.
4. While the current string does not start with the `prefix`, remove the last character from the `prefix`.
5. If the `prefix` becomes an empty string, there is no common prefix, so return an empty string.
6. After iterating through all the strings, return the `prefix`.

Here's the implementation in Python:

```python
class Solution(object):
    def longestCommonPrefix(self, strs):
        if len(strs) == 0:
            return ""
        
        prefix = strs[0]
        
        for i in range(1, len(strs)):
            while not strs[i].startswith(prefix):
                prefix = prefix[:-1]
                if prefix == "":
                    return ""
        
        return prefix
```

Now, you can create an instance of the `Solution` class and call the `longestCommonPrefix` method with the given input:

```python
solution = Solution()
strs = ["flower", "flow", "flight"]
result = solution.longestCommonPrefix(strs)
print(result)  # Output: "fl"
```

The `longestCommonPrefix` method takes `strs` as an argument and returns the longest common prefix string among the array of strings. The algorithm runs in O(n*m) time complexity, where n is the number of strings and m is the length of the longest string.
