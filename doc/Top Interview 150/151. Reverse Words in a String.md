Given an input string s, reverse the order of the words.

A word is defined as a sequence of non-space characters. The words in s will be separated by at least one space.

Return a string of the words in reverse order concatenated by a single space.

Note that s may contain leading or trailing spaces or multiple spaces between two words. The returned string should only have a single space separating the words. Do not include any extra spaces.

 

Example 1:

Input: s = "the sky is blue"
Output: "blue is sky the"
Example 2:

Input: s = "  hello world  "
Output: "world hello"
Explanation: Your reversed string should not contain leading or trailing spaces.
Example 3:

Input: s = "a good   example"
Output: "example good a"
Explanation: You need to reduce multiple spaces between two words to a single space in the reversed string.
 

Constraints:

1 <= s.length <= 104
s contains English letters (upper-case and lower-case), digits, and spaces ' '.
There is at least one word in s.
 

Follow-up: If the string data type is mutable in your language, can you solve it in-place with O(1) extra space?

```python
class Solution(object):
    def reverseWords(self, s):
        """
        :type s: str
        :rtype: str
        """
```

To reverse the order of words in a string `s`, you can follow the following algorithm:

1. Split the string `s` into individual words using the space character as the delimiter. This will give you a list of words.
2. Reverse the order of the words in the list.
3. Join the reversed words using a single space character as the separator.
4. Return the resulting string.

Here's the implementation in Python:

```python
class Solution(object):
    def reverseWords(self, s):
        words = s.split()
        reversed_words = words[::-1]
        reversed_string = " ".join(reversed_words)
        return reversed_string
```

Now, you can create an instance of the `Solution` class and call the `reverseWords` method with the given input:

```python
solution = Solution()
s = "the sky is blue"
result = solution.reverseWords(s)
print(result)  # Output: "blue is sky the"
```

The `reverseWords` method takes `s` as an argument and returns the reversed order of the words in the string. The algorithm has a time complexity of O(n), where n is the length of the string.
