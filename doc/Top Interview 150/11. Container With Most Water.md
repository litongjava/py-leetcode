You are given an integer array height of length n. There are n vertical lines drawn such that the two endpoints of the ith line are (i, 0) and (i, height[i]).

Find two lines that together with the x-axis form a container, such that the container contains the most water.

Return the maximum amount of water a container can store.

Notice that you may not slant the container.

 

Example 1:
![](images/question_11.jpg)

Input: height = [1,8,6,2,5,4,8,3,7]
Output: 49
Explanation: The above vertical lines are represented by array [1,8,6,2,5,4,8,3,7]. In this case, the max area of water (blue section) the container can contain is 49.
Example 2:

Input: height = [1,1]
Output: 1
 

Constraints:

n == height.length
2 <= n <= 10^5
0 <= height[i] <= 10^4

```python
class Solution(object):
    def maxArea(self, height):
        """
        :type height: List[int]
        :rtype: int
        """
```

The problem you provided is known as the "Container With Most Water" problem on LeetCode. The task is to find two vertical lines in an array that, along with the x-axis, forms a container, and the goal is to maximize the amount of water the container can hold.

The problem can be solved using a two-pointer approach. Here's the implementation of the `maxArea` function in Python:

```python
class Solution(object):
    def maxArea(self, height):
        """
        :type height: List[int]
        :rtype: int
        """
        left = 0  # left pointer
        right = len(height) - 1  # right pointer
        max_area = 0  # variable to store the maximum area
        
        while left < right:
            # Calculate the area between the two lines
            area = min(height[left], height[right]) * (right - left)
            
            # Update max_area if the current area is greater
            max_area = max(max_area, area)
            
            # Move the pointer pointing to the shorter line
            if height[left] < height[right]:
                left += 1
            else:
                right -= 1
        
        return max_area
```

The two-pointer approach starts with the two pointers, `left` and `right`, pointing to the first and last lines of the array. We calculate the area between the lines using the formula: `area = min(height[left], height[right]) * (right - left)`.

We update `max_area` if the current area is greater than the previous maximum. Then, we move the pointer pointing to the shorter line towards the other line.

By iterating through the array with the two pointers, we find the maximum area that can be formed by any two lines. Finally, we return the `max_area` as the result.

The time complexity of this solution is O(n), where n is the length of the input array.
