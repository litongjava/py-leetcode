Given an array of strings words and a width maxWidth, format the text such that each line has exactly maxWidth characters and is fully (left and right) justified.

You should pack your words in a greedy approach; that is, pack as many words as you can in each line. Pad extra spaces ' ' when necessary so that each line has exactly maxWidth characters.

Extra spaces between words should be distributed as evenly as possible. If the number of spaces on a line does not divide evenly between words, the empty slots on the left will be assigned more spaces than the slots on the right.

For the last line of text, it should be left-justified, and no extra space is inserted between words.

Note:

A word is defined as a character sequence consisting of non-space characters only.
Each word's length is guaranteed to be greater than 0 and not exceed maxWidth.
The input array words contains at least one word.
 

Example 1:

Input: words = ["This", "is", "an", "example", "of", "text", "justification."], maxWidth = 16
Output:
[
   "This    is    an",
   "example  of text",
   "justification.  "
]
Example 2:

Input: words = ["What","must","be","acknowledgment","shall","be"], maxWidth = 16
Output:
[
  "What   must   be",
  "acknowledgment  ",
  "shall be        "
]
Explanation: Note that the last line is "shall be    " instead of "shall     be", because the last line must be left-justified instead of fully-justified.
Note that the second line is also left-justified because it contains only one word.
Example 3:

Input: words = ["Science","is","what","we","understand","well","enough","to","explain","to","a","computer.","Art","is","everything","else","we","do"], maxWidth = 20
Output:
[
  "Science  is  what we",
  "understand      well",
  "enough to explain to",
  "a  computer.  Art is",
  "everything  else  we",
  "do                  "
]
 

Constraints:

1 <= words.length <= 300
1 <= words[i].length <= 20
words[i] consists of only English letters and symbols.
1 <= maxWidth <= 100
words[i].length <= maxWidth

```python
class Solution(object):
    def fullJustify(self, words, maxWidth):
        """
        :type words: List[str]
        :type maxWidth: int
        :rtype: List[str]
        """
```

The `fullJustify` function takes a list of words `words` and a maximum width `maxWidth` as input and returns a list of strings where each line has exactly `maxWidth` characters and is fully justified.

To solve this problem, you can iterate through the words and pack as many words as possible in each line, considering the space constraints. You can keep track of the current line's words and calculate the number of spaces needed to distribute evenly. For the last line, you should left-justify the text.

Here's an implementation of the `fullJustify` function:

```python
class Solution(object):
    def fullJustify(self, words, maxWidth):
        result = []
        curr_line = []
        curr_width = 0

        for word in words:
            if curr_width + len(curr_line) + len(word) <= maxWidth:
                curr_line.append(word)
                curr_width += len(word)
            else:
                result.append(self.justify_line(curr_line, curr_width, maxWidth))
                curr_line = [word]
                curr_width = len(word)

        # Handle the last line
        result.append(self.left_justify(curr_line, curr_width, maxWidth))

        return result

    def justify_line(self, line, curr_width, maxWidth):
        num_words = len(line)
        num_spaces = maxWidth - curr_width

        if num_words == 1:
            return line[0] + ' ' * num_spaces

        avg_spaces = num_spaces // (num_words - 1)
        extra_spaces = num_spaces % (num_words - 1)

        justified_line = ''
        for i in range(num_words - 1):
            justified_line += line[i] + ' ' * avg_spaces
            if extra_spaces > 0:
                justified_line += ' '
                extra_spaces -= 1

        justified_line += line[-1]
        return justified_line

    def left_justify(self, line, curr_width, maxWidth):
        justified_line = ' '.join(line)
        justified_line += ' ' * (maxWidth - curr_width - len(line) + 1)
        return justified_line
```

Now, you can create an instance of the `Solution` class and call the `fullJustify` method with the given input:

```python
solution = Solution()
words = ["This", "is", "an", "example", "of", "text", "justification."]
maxWidth = 16
result = solution.fullJustify(words, maxWidth)
print(result)
```

The `fullJustify` method takes the `words` list and `maxWidth` as arguments and returns the list of strings where each line is fully justified.
