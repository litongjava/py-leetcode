Given a string s, find the length of the longest 
substring
 without repeating characters.

 

Example 1:

Input: s = "abcabcbb"
Output: 3
Explanation: The answer is "abc", with the length of 3.
Example 2:

Input: s = "bbbbb"
Output: 1
Explanation: The answer is "b", with the length of 1.
Example 3:

Input: s = "pwwkew"
Output: 3
Explanation: The answer is "wke", with the length of 3.
Notice that the answer must be a substring, "pwke" is a subsequence and not a substring.
 

Constraints:

0 <= s.length <= 5 * 104
s consists of English letters, digits, symbols and spaces.

```python
class Solution(object):
    def lengthOfLongestSubstring(self, s):
        """
        :type s: str
        :rtype: int
        """
```

The problem you provided is the "Longest Substring Without Repeating Characters" problem on LeetCode. The task is to find the length of the longest substring in the given string that does not contain any repeating characters.

To solve this problem, you can use a sliding window approach with a hash set to keep track of the unique characters in the current substring. Here's the implementation of the `lengthOfLongestSubstring` function in Python:

```python
class Solution(object):
    def lengthOfLongestSubstring(self, s):
        """
        :type s: str
        :rtype: int
        """
        n = len(s)
        char_set = set()
        max_length = 0
        left = 0  # left pointer
        
        for right in range(n):
            # If the current character is already in the set, move the left pointer
            while s[right] in char_set:
                char_set.remove(s[left])
                left += 1
            
            char_set.add(s[right])
            max_length = max(max_length, right - left + 1)
        
        return max_length
```

The sliding window approach starts with two pointers, `left` and `right`, pointing to the beginning of the string. We also have a hash set, `char_set`, to store the unique characters in the current substring.

We move the `right` pointer to the right, and for each character, we check if it is already in the `char_set`. If it is, it means we have a repeating character, so we remove the characters from the `char_set` and move the `left` pointer to the right until the repeating character is no longer in the set.

After that, we add the current character to the `char_set` and update the `max_length` if the length of the current substring is greater than the previous maximum.

By iterating through the string with the two pointers, we find the length of the longest substring without repeating characters. Finally, we return `max_length` as the result.

The time complexity of this solution is O(n), where n is the length of the input string.
