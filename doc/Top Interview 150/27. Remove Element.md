Given an integer array nums and an integer val, remove all occurrences of val in nums in-place. The order of the elements may be changed. Then return the number of elements in nums which are not equal to val.

Consider the number of elements in nums which are not equal to val be k, to get accepted, you need to do the following things:

Change the array nums such that the first k elements of nums contain the elements which are not equal to val. The remaining elements of nums are not important as well as the size of nums.
Return k.
Custom Judge:

The judge will test your solution with the following code:

int[] nums = [...]; // Input array
int val = ...; // Value to remove
int[] expectedNums = [...]; // The expected answer with correct length.
                            // It is sorted with no values equaling val.

int k = removeElement(nums, val); // Calls your implementation

assert k == expectedNums.length;
sort(nums, 0, k); // Sort the first k elements of nums
for (int i = 0; i < actualLength; i++) {
    assert nums[i] == expectedNums[i];
}
If all assertions pass, then your solution will be accepted.

 

Example 1:

Input: nums = [3,2,2,3], val = 3
Output: 2, nums = [2,2,_,_]
Explanation: Your function should return k = 2, with the first two elements of nums being 2.
It does not matter what you leave beyond the returned k (hence they are underscores).
Example 2:

Input: nums = [0,1,2,2,3,0,4,2], val = 2
Output: 5, nums = [0,1,4,0,3,_,_,_]
Explanation: Your function should return k = 5, with the first five elements of nums containing 0, 0, 1, 3, and 4.
Note that the five elements can be returned in any order.
It does not matter what you leave beyond the returned k (hence they are underscores).
 

Constraints:

0 <= nums.length <= 100
0 <= nums[i] <= 50
0 <= val <= 100

```python
class Solution(object):
    def removeElement(self, nums, val):
        """
        :type nums: List[int]
        :type val: int
        :rtype: int
        """
```

To remove all occurrences of a given value `val` from the integer array `nums` in-place, you can use a two-pointer approach. Here's the step-by-step algorithm to solve the problem:

1. Initialize two pointers, `i` and `j`, both initially pointing to the start of the array (`0`).

2. Iterate through the array with the pointer `j`:
   - If the element at `nums[j]` is equal to `val`, increment `j` to skip this element.
   - If the element at `nums[j]` is not equal to `val`, set `nums[i]` to `nums[j]` and increment both `i` and `j`.

3. Return the value of `i`, which represents the number of elements in `nums` that are not equal to `val`.

Here's the implementation in Python:

```python
class Solution(object):
    def removeElement(self, nums, val):
        i = 0
        for j in range(len(nums)):
            if nums[j] != val:
                nums[i] = nums[j]
                i += 1
        return i
```

Now, you can create an instance of the `Solution` class and call the `removeElement` method with the given input:

```python
solution = Solution()
nums = [3, 2, 2, 3]
val = 3
k = solution.removeElement(nums, val)
print(k)  # Output: 2
print(nums[:k])  # Output: [2, 2]
```

The `removeElement` method takes `nums` and `val` as arguments and returns the number of elements in `nums` that are not equal to `val`. The modified array `nums` will contain the non-val elements in the first `k` positions.
