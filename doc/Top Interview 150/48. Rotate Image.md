You are given an n x n 2D matrix representing an image, rotate the image by 90 degrees (clockwise).

You have to rotate the image in-place, which means you have to modify the input 2D matrix directly. DO NOT allocate another 2D matrix and do the rotation.

 

Example 1:
![](images/mat1.jpg)

Input: matrix = [[1,2,3],[4,5,6],[7,8,9]]
Output: [[7,4,1],[8,5,2],[9,6,3]]
Example 2:
![](images/mat2.jpg)

Input: matrix = [[5,1,9,11],[2,4,8,10],[13,3,6,7],[15,14,12,16]]
Output: [[15,13,2,5],[14,3,4,1],[12,6,8,9],[16,7,10,11]]
 

Constraints:

n == matrix.length == matrix[i].length
1 <= n <= 20
-1000 <= matrix[i][j] <= 1000

```python
class Solution(object):
    def rotate(self, matrix):
        """
        :type matrix: List[List[int]]
        :rtype: None Do not return anything, modify matrix in-place instead.
        """
```

The problem you provided is the "Rotate Image" problem on LeetCode. The task is to rotate a given n x n 2D matrix by 90 degrees clockwise in place, without allocating another 2D matrix.

To solve this problem, you can perform the rotation in layers, starting from the outermost layer and moving towards the inner layers. Here's the implementation of the `rotate` function in Python:

```python
class Solution(object):
    def rotate(self, matrix):
        """
        :type matrix: List[List[int]]
        :rtype: None Do not return anything, modify matrix in-place instead.
        """
        n = len(matrix)
        
        # Transpose the matrix
        for i in range(n):
            for j in range(i, n):
                matrix[i][j], matrix[j][i] = matrix[j][i], matrix[i][j]
        
        # Reverse each row
        for i in range(n):
            matrix[i] = matrix[i][::-1]
```

The rotation is performed in two steps: transposition and row reversal.

In the transposition step, we iterate through the matrix and swap each element with its corresponding element in the transposed position. This step effectively flips the matrix diagonally.

In the row reversal step, we reverse each row of the matrix, effectively rotating the elements 90 degrees clockwise.

By combining these two steps, we achieve the desired rotation of the matrix. The result is stored directly in the `matrix` list, modifying it in place.

The time complexity of this solution is O(n^2), where n is the size of the matrix.
